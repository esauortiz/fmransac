model_class: EllipseModel
dim: 2 # dimension of the model
xc : [0,0] # x component of the ellipse's center
yc : [0,0] # y component of the ellipse's center
a : [6,7]  # radius of the ellipse along x axis of the ellipse
b : [4,5]  # radius of the ellipse along y axis of the ellipse
theta : [0,3140] # rotation w.r.t. world x axis. theta in rads will de divided by 10^-3 later
samples : 1000 # number of samples of the dataset whose samples 'fits perfectly' to the model
